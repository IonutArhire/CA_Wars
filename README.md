# CA_Wars

*CA_Wars is a project dear to me that combines 2 things I'm very interested about: game design and cellular automata. If you don't know what cellular automata is, I highly encourage you to research it. It's a very interesting and creativity-based field. Here's a link to a demo of a project that uses cellular automata to create interesting sounds :D (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQnmL-OIznc&ab_channel=EW)*



Cellular Automata Wars is a browser-based game in which players compete using strategy and experience to win against other players or train in singleplayer mode to attain knowledge and have some sandbox type of fun, meaning everything is possible.
